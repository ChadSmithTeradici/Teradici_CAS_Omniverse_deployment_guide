This script is designed to allow Teradici end users to power on their EC2 instances remotely without having to access the EC2 dashboard. It will also find the public or elastic IP of the instances and pass the connection info to a PCoIP connection string automatically. While larger Teradici deployments will benefit from [Cloud Access Manager (CASM)](https://www.teradici.com/web-help/cas_manager_as_a_service/) when multiple instances reside in the same region. It is cost prohibited to run CASM connection gateways (CAC) when only a handful of userâ€™s instances per region are needed and/or customer are interested in leveraging AWS local zones where the cost of perpetually running a CAC is cost prohibited.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of AWS Cloud and assumes Teradici subscription, including the following:
+   [AWS EC2 Instance](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/), including vCPUs, memory, disk, and GPUs
+   [Internet egress and transfer costs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-of-data-transfer-costs-for-common-architectures/), for PCoIP and other applications communications.

Use the [AWS pricing calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.
